Great — the next **logical module after Node Management** is:

# ⭐ **FIBER ROUTE MANAGEMENT MODULE**

*("This module handles all fiber routes, paths, new drops, updates, changes, distances, routing maps, and the visual representation of the entire network offline.")*

Below is the **FULL workflow logic**, clean, no coding — pure functional design.

---

# 🔷 **1. ROUTE DATABASE & LOADING WORKFLOW**

### **1.1 Load All Fiber Routes**

When a user opens the module:

* System loads every fiber route stored offline
* Displays:

  * Route names
  * Start → End nodes
  * Length
  * Type (Distribution, Access, Drop, Backbone)
  * Cable size (12F, 24F, 48F, 96F, 144F…)
  * Status (Completed, Under Construction, Faulty, Pending Survey)

### **1.2 Map Auto-Drawing**

The system:

* Reads route coordinates
* Draws routes on the offline map
* Color-codes them:

  * Blue = Backbone
  * Yellow = Distribution
  * Green = Access
  * White = Drops
  * Red = Faulty / Under maintenance

---

# 🔷 **2. ROUTE CREATION WORKFLOW**

Triggered when the user selects **“Add Route”**

### **2.1 Route Type Selection**

User chooses:

* Backbone route
* Distribution route
* Access route
* Drop route

### **2.2 Route Creation Methods**

Two ways to draw:

#### **Method A: GPS Auto Draw**

* User taps “Start Route”
* App records GPS path as user walks the line
* User taps “Stop Route” → system calculates:

  * Distance
  * Coordinates
  * Path shape

#### **Method B: Manual Map Draw**

* User taps points on map
* App draws a line linking them
* Auto calculates distance between each segment

### **2.3 Route Attributes**

User fills:

* Route name
* Fiber size (12F/24F/48F…)
* Cable type (ADSS, G652D, G657A…)
* Depth (if underground)
* From Node → To Node
* Photos of burial / pole installation
* Notes

### **2.4 Save Route**

System:

* Saves route
* Adds to map
* Updates distance database
* Links route to node chain

---

# 🔷 **3. ROUTE DISTANCE MANAGEMENT**

### **3.1 Auto Distance Calculator (Important Feature)**

For every segment:

* System uses the coordinate pairs to calculate length
* Adds all segments → total distance
* Stores it for reports
* Shows “expected vs actual distance” if GPS was used

### **3.2 Manual Distance Override**

User can override if actual distance differs:

* Due to bends
* Slack
* Reserve coils
* Extra length at poles/fat/domes

---

# 🔷 **4. ROUTE–NODE LINKING WORKFLOW**

Every route must connect nodes.

### **4.1 Auto Link**

When a route begins at Node A and ends at Node B:

* System auto attaches route → node records
* Chain updates by itself

### **4.2 Manual Link**

User can reassign start or end nodes:

* Select route
* Choose “Relink Start / Relink End”
* Pick a new node

### **4.3 Split Route**

User can split a long route at a new node:

* Select “Split Route”
* Tap point on map
* Enter node info
* System:

  * Creates new node
  * Splits route into two
  * Updates power chain

---

# 🔷 **5. ROUTE CONDITION & MAINTENANCE WORKFLOW**

For faults, repairs, upgrades:

### **5.1 Mark Fault**

User taps segment → “Report Fault”

* Adds fault type:

  * Cut
  * Low power
  * Attenuation
  * Water in closure
  * Pole damage
  * Rodent damage
* Adds photos, notes
* System draws red segment on map

### **5.2 Mark Repair Completed**

* Updates segment back to normal
* Adds repair photos
* Adds technician info

---

# 🔷 **6. ROUTE INVENTORY WORKFLOW**

Each route uses materials:

* Cable type
* Cable size
* Kilometers used
